==== Powershell ====

dotless uses PSake by James Kovacs to compile.
PSake is a powershell based build tool and is packed with the source (psake.ps1).

To build simply execute psake.ps1.

Possible build targets:
* Clean = Removes all build artefacts
* Build = Builds the main dotless library
* Test = Builds testproject and runs Unit tests using NUnit
* Merge = Merges PegBase assembly into dotless release assembly
* Release = (Default) Executes Build, Test, Merge and creates a release zip.

To run another build targert simply run:
PS> .\psake .\default.ps1 <target>


Note:
You may need to execute the following command before being able to execute the script:
Set-ExecutionPolicy remotesigned
(Make sure you run this as administrator)



==== NAnt ====

dotless also provides a NAnt build script for those who don't have powershell installed.
Please ensure that the lastet version of NAnt and NAntContrib are installed and included in the path.

To build simply execute nant.

The NAnt script contains the same possible build targets as above.

To run another build targert simply run:
nant <target>
